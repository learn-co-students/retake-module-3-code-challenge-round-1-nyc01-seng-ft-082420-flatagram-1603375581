# Flatagram

Today you'll be building an app for viewing, liking, and commenting on a single picture. You will be using a local API and building out the frontend for our app, Flatagram.

## Demo

Use this gif as an example of how the app should work.

![demo gif](assets/demo.gif)

## Setup

- Fork and clone this repository
- Run `json-server --watch db.json` to get the backend started
- Open the `index.html` file on your browser

## Endpoints

Your base URL for your API will be: http://localhost:3000

The endpoints you will need are:

- GET `/image`
- PATCH `/image`

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I can:

- See the image received from the server, including its likes and comments when the page loads
- Click on the heart icon to increase image likes, and still see them when I reload the page
- Add a comment (no persistence needed)

## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I can:

- Still see the comments written after reloading the page
- Downvote an image
- Delete a comment
